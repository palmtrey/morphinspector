## To Do  
* Create script that automatically orders import statements upon github commit
* Create exportation of data to a formatted csv file
* Allow users to run NearFace from within the app
* Allow users to streamline data from NearFace (csv files) -> details file (dictionary dumped to .txt file) -> encapsulated morphs cache
* Create templates of specific helpful plots (users can generate custom plots using Excel with the exported csv files if they wish to create more complicated plots)
* Change naming standards to accomodate additional FRE backends
* Develop ranking system for morphs
* Create installer script and automated building
* Integrate morph/still renaming for maximum compatibility
* Ensure application works on Windows
