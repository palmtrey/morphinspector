# Morph Inspector
Morph Inspector provides a clean and comprehensive GUI application for inspecting face morphs.

## Background
Face morphs are created through the use of neural networks for the purpose of fooling a facial recognition engine (FRE). Research is being conducted at multiple universities across the United States to create high-quality face morphs for the purpose of training a defensive neural network to detect these morphs. After creation of morphs, Morph Inspector provides statistics, analysis, and visual inspection of the images.

## Installation
Morph Inspector is still under development - installation instructions to come.
